# This is meant for armbian PiKVM use -- required to make NFS MSD work properly (in effect since kvmd 3.206)
#
# In summary, this script will perform the following steps:
: "
1.  take the contents of /usr/lib/python3.11/site-packages/aiofiles from arch pikvm and extract it to armbian
2.  rename aiofiles within /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages to aiofiles.YYYYMMDD.hhmm
3.  create symlink to /usr/lib/python3.11/site-packages/aiofiles into /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages
4.  restart kvmd
